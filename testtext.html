	<p>I found the reading to be fabulously interesting in regards to its main point 
			that the emergence of mobile technology and innovation sparked a revolution in 
			many aspects, including business, ethics, sociology, and even the human 
			condition. The first article, "Controlled Consumption Culture: When Digital 
			Culture Becomes Software Business, Soren Bro Pold and Christian Ulrik Andersen",
			describes the interesting nature people have been seen with how consumers use 
			and manipulate the mobile platform. The "digital culture" has disrupted the typical 
			notion of culture, and has fundamentally changed how people have perceived 
			such aspects as intellectual rights, property, media, communication, innovation, 
			and consumer needs. Consequently, there are new business ventures, models, and 
			company/software infrastructures that have formed in the last decade or so.
			While early on engaged upon as a tool for artistic experimentation, it has blossomed
			into a full on business with new tools, features, and uses to be sold on the market.
			The Apple Store has hosted many of these new "apps" and has induced a sort of 
			controlled consumption that is made up of 4 parts: 1. an infrastructure to 
			hold up this e-commerce 2. consumption monitored closely to look for marketing and 
			product patterns 3. limits placed on products to control obsolescense 4.  it controls 
			our everyday use and organization of the mobile platforms. It concludes with our need 
			to reflect and discuss this emerging digital culture, its impact on the average consumer, 
			and the many aspects of freedom, privacy and ethics in which we find ourselves struggling with today in other 
			areas.

		The other portion of the reading, "Auxiliary Organs, The Ethics of an Extended Mind", revolves around how 
			we as humans interpret our being as the tools of our survival, and how some argue that in this digital era,
			our adaptation to the modern world has been attributed to the tools of the emerging mobile technology. In this reading,
			it defines our auxiliary organs as a "platform" and not just a single-function tool. In this, it extendes the "single-function tools"
			as our everyday "apps".
